h1. GeoDistance - geo distance calculations

Calculates the Geo distance between two locations using longitude and latitude. 
This is done using "pure" Math formulas without resorting to Active Record or SQL DB functionality

This gem is meant to be a replacement for those geo distance utils out there that use built in SQL DB functionality for their calculations!

The formulas curently supported are

* _Haversine_
* _Spherical_
* _Vincenty_

h2. Install & Usage

<pre>require 'geo-distance'

it "should work" do
  lon1 = -104.88544
  lat1 = 39.06546

  lon2 = -104.80
  lat2 = lat1

  dist = GeoDistance::Haversine.distance( lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2 )

  puts "the distance from  #{lat1}, #{lon1} to #{lat2}, #{lon2} is: #{dist[:meters].number} meters"

  puts "#{dist[:feet]}"
  puts "#{dist.meters}"
  puts "#{dist[:km]}"
  puts "#{dist[:miles]}"
  dist[:km].to_s.should match(/7\.376*/)
end  
</pre>

h3. Setting default algorithm

You can also set a default algorithm to use...
The following will use the _Haversine_ algorithm:

<pre>
  GeoDistance.default_algorithm = :haversine
  dist = GeoDistance.distance( lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2 )  
</pre>

GeoDistance is used in the "geo_magic":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/geo_magic gem

h2. Contributing to geo-distance
 
* Check out the specs and add specs to spec any added features or changes!
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
